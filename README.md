## Project's context

The software development changed dramaticaly during the last decade. From a software engineering based on adding computers to information systems that already exist, arose a (not so) new paradigm, the creation of software products. These software products are brand new information systems, i.e. social networks, based on the human pratices but adding an entire new context.

## Project's objective

The main objectives here are demonstrate and exercise the a good part of the roadmap to create a software product, and to develop my personal abilities with the Go language.

## Project's structure

The repository is divided in two folders:

- docs - in this folder there's the product vision, personas, scenarios, user stories and prototipes (mainly Figma files);
- src - the source code and other necessary files.
