# Product Vision[^1]

TO consumers and producers, THAT deal with organic products, THE Little Cooperative Shop IS AN e-commerce THAT shortens the distance between buyers and producers through a minimalist interface. Different from supermarkt delivery apps OUR PRODUCT offers only certified organic products and makes possible to producers to sell their products directly to the consumers.

[^1] Product Vision model is based on Crossing the Chasm by Geoffrey Moore and Engineering Software Products by Ian Sommerville.
