## #1 - buying products

Carla needs to buy groceries to the week. During an interval at work, she authenticates herself at OrganicLocker and starts to browse the Markertplace. Carla filters the virtual stores by selecting the products the wants, the delivery/collect location and the date of delivery. The website exhibits the producers that deliver at least one of the desired products at the delivery/collect location at the the chosen date.

Among the showed producers, Carla clicks on one and she ist redirected to its virtual store. She adds to the basket some products. Then she returns to the page showing the virtual stores, where she visits another one and adds other products to the basket before advancing to close the purchase.

In the close of purchase page, Carla selects the delivery/collect location for each product and the date. As Carla already uses OrganicLocker, she selects a registered credit card and closes the purchase.


## #2 - refilling stock

Manoel wants to refill his stock at OrganicLocker. In the seller panel Manoel goes to "My Products", where all his products are listed and shows which one is available or not. Manoel just made a new batch of apple jam, so he enables the already registered apple jam, and inputs the quantity available to sell and its date of expiration. The product automatically appears on Manoel's virtual store.

## #3 - registering new products

Manoel started to produce fig jam and wants to sell it at OrganicLocker. Therefore he goes to the seller panel, at "My Products" page, and presses "add product". He then registers the product with product name, photo, details. After that, he's redirected back to "My Products", where he makes the fig jam available to selling.

## #4 - deliver/collect products

After Carla closing a purchase, Manoel receives a notification. He confirms the transaction and Carla is then notified. In the scheduled day, Manoel unlocks the delivery box at the delivery location through a QR code created by OrganicLocker. Manoel locks the delivery box after he puts all the products bought by Carla and she receives a notification that says her products are available to collect.
The next day, Carla goes to the product box and with a QR code created by OrganicLocker she opens it. She collects the products and confirms at OrganicLocker that all products have been delivered. Manoel is notified and a value is added to his account.

## #5 - partial cancellation by seller
