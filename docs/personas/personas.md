Manoel, 65, retired bus driver and small rural producer. After retiring, Manoel bought a small farm (chácara) near the city with all his lifetime savings. He decided to use his free time and the fruit produced in his new farm to produce, with his wife, Fátima, 62, organic jellies, jams and marmalades to complement their income. With the help of a local rural producers association, Manoel created labels and packings for his products, and got a "organic producer certification" also. Due to his age and medical condition, Manoel can't participate in organic food fairs, which leads him to sell his products to middlemen. He would like a website where he could sell his products directly to consumers.

**Critical tasks:**
1. Post products to sell.
